# Let & Const

**Blocks are not scopes???**

The let statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.

Can I use **let** and **Const** now?
