# Comments
We normally use Comments to describe how and why the code works.
Comments are used to add annotation, hints, suggestions, or warnings to JavaScript code.
This can make it easier to read and understand. 
They can also be used to disable code to prevent it from being executed.
This can be a valuable debugging tool.


```Practical Code Examples using JavaScript```

Comments can be single-line: starting with // 

```
// generate user ticket
function triggerEvent(param){
   return ...
```


and multiline: /* ... */

```
// generate user ticket

/* function triggerEvent(param){
   return ...
} */
```
