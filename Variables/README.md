# Variables

A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.

**Question** Can I use **var** and **let** now?
**Answer:** JavaScript ES6 added a new keyword, **let**, that could be used to declare variables, just like var, but with better scoping rules.
