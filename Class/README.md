# Class

Classes in JavaScript are a special syntax for its prototypical inheritance model that is a comparable inheritance in class-based object oriented languages. Classes are just special functions added to ES6 that are meant to mimic the class keyword from these other languages. In JavaScript, we can have class declarations and class expressions, because they are just functions. So like all other functions, there are function declarations and function expressions.

Classes serve as templates to create new objects.

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.
